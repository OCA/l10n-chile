Installation
============

We recommend you also install the following modules for a better experience:

* account_invoice_prices_update (purchases)
* base_currency_inverse_rate (to see the inverse rate, which is always more familiar to your brain)

Upgrade
~~~~~~~

If you are upgrading from previous versions, we advise you to delete the UF
and UTM currencies. This way the external reference name will be correctly
established.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module

* Get your own API key from http://api.sbif.cl/api/
* Go to Settings
* Activate the develop mode
* Go to Settings > Technical > Parameters > System Parameters
* Edit the key "sbif.financial.indicators.apikey"
* Enter your API key in the value


Usage
=====

* Go to Accounting
* Create a multi-currency transaction (customer invoice or vendor bill) to
  use the exchange rate given by SBIF

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Launch a wizard during the installation to add your API key
* Use the Automatic Exchange Rate Update in the Accounting Settings

Changelog
=========

Version 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancements of this version

1. Ensure that base currency is set to CLP
2. Adds UF y UTM as currencies. In case they have been deleted, it also adds USD and EUR
3. Allow to manage update of each currency manually.
4. It makes calculation with needed precision.
5. Dependency: this module depends on a generic webservices module, which acts
   as a repository for more webservices (webservices_generic)
   webservices_generic allows to add several kind of webservices you could
   need inside Odoo.
