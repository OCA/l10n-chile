Prepare and send data files to the Xerox service,
that will then be responsoble for SII documentation of the legal documents,
and provide additional document management services.

The documents to send are arranged in "groups".
The default group is by day.
The Field Services extension makes this group to also be by route (or truck).

Each document group will be a directory, with a specific name and file structure,
that be sent to Xerox through FTP.
